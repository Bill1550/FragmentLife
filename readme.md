A small project to explore creating a standard mechanism to manage the View Bindiing.

Objectives:

1. A way to ensure that the binding reference is always destroyed when the views are detached.
2. Minimum boiler plate, especially the name of the binding (i.e. FragmentMainBinding) should only have to be type once.
3. A clear way to access the views that helps disambiguate view names for fields in the fragment.
